### Python Graph Kernels

`pygk` is a python implementation (under development) of a subset of graph kernels and other related methods based on [MATLAB codes](http://www.di.ens.fr/~shervashidze/code/Graphkernels/graphkernels.zip) by [Nino Shervashidze](http://www.di.ens.fr/~shervashidze).

Following graph kernels are implemented:

- Shortest path kernel (for both unlabeled and discretely-labeled graph)
- Random walk kernel (for both unlabeled and discretely-labeled graph)
- Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel (for discretely-labeled graph)
- 3-graphlet kernel (for discretely-labeled graph)
- (3,4,5)-graphlet kernel (for unlabeled graph)
